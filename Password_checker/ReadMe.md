# 🔐 Password Strength Checker & Generator

A Python-based tool to evaluate password strength using **entropy analysis, breach detection, and common password checks**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Strength Scoring** (0-100) based on:
  - Length, complexity (uppercase, digits, symbols)
  - Entropy (bits) for randomness measurement
  - Penalties for common/breached passwords
- **HaveIBeenPwned API Integration** (checks if password was leaked)
- **Common Password Detection**

## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
